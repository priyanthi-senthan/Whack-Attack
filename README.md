** Whac-a-Mole Game Project Documentation**

This project is an extended and customized version of the Whac-a-Mole game.

### Source of Inspiration:
- **Tutorial**: Kenny Yip Coding
- **URL**: [https://www.kennyyipcoding.com/whac-a-mole/](https://www.kennyyipcoding.com/whac-a-mole/)
- **Description**: The tutorial provided the core concept and images for the game. However, the game logic, user interface, and additional features were customized to enhance the overall gameplay experience.

### My Contributions:
1. **User Management**:
   - **Registration page**: Allows users to register with a username and password.
   - **Login page**: Validates user credentials and starts a personalized session.
   - **Logout functionality**: Ends the session and redirects the user.

2. **Frontend Enhancements**:
   - Added responsive design using CSS.
   - Improved game UI for a better user experience, including layout and visuals.

3. **Game Features**:
   - Added a scoreboard to track high scores.
   - Linked user profiles to personalized game statistics.
   - **Bonus Feature**: Integrated a **banana API** to provide bonus scores during the game.

4. **API Integration**:
   - **Banana API**: This API is used to generate bonus points for players who hit specific targets during the game. The API call fetches data from a publicly available endpoint that adds random bonus points during gameplay.

5. **File Structure**:
   - Organized HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files for modularity.

### How to Play:
1. Visit the game webpage.
2. Register or log in to start playing.
3. Hit the moles as they appear to gain points and bonus scores.
4. Keep track of your high scores in the scoreboard.
5. Log out when you're done!

### Future Enhancements:
- Adding multiplayer support.
- Improving game mechanics and difficulty levels.
- Extending the API integration to include other fun features.
